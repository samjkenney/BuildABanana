Build-A-Banana is a web game meant to instill a bond between the player and their banana, and destroy that bond by cooking the banana. 

This game is built using a template from Phaser, linked here. 

## Requirements
Node.js is required to install dependencies and run scripts via npm.

After pulling this code for the first time, you will have to run *npm install* in the terminal.

To compile and build the code, run *npm run dev* in the terminal. Then, click *http://localhost:8080* to view the web version. 

To build, run *npm run build* in the terminal. Then, upload the contents of the *dist* folder to a public-facing web server. For this project, we used Netlify.
